Development of a multi-container infrastructure with Docker to deploy a secure web application. The project involved creating distinct services for NGINX, WordPress, and MariaDB, as well as setting up Docker volumes for data persistence and a Docker network for communication between the services.

Use `make` to initiate the deployment. Your wordpress website will be reachable on `hvecchio.42.fr` (a security warning is expected) and you can manage the DB manually on `adminer.hvecchio.42.fr` (logins in the .env file).
